This is the repository for the Full Stack Photo Tagging Application built for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app).

The application is an interactive version of 'Where's Waldo?', a game where players have to exactly locate several characters inside a picture.

The goal of the project was to practice the backend and server-side workflow by using the backend as a service platform Firebase.
